# content-releases
This module offer a convenient way to keep track of the content which has been created/modified,
and published on the go-live.

## Overview
When preparing an update of a web project (e.g. a new product launch or a marketing campaign),
editors work on pages and content that can be spread across the website.
The *content releases* module offer a convenient way to keep track of the content which has been
created/modified, and published on the go-live.

### How does it work?
In a dedicated panel, available in jContent>Additional, users can create a new content release.
To associate pages or content to a release, editors need to open Content Editor, activate the option “Content Release”, and then select the available releases. It is possible to attach a content/page to several releases. Then Save.

Back in jContent>Additional>Content releases, you can then see the list of content releases, and the number of associated content. By clicking on the line, a new tab will open, and will list all the contents of the release. From there, you can:
Open Content Editor to directly make modifications on the content
Use the “Open in Page Composer” option, to either open the page in Page Composer, or to open the page containing the content in Page Composer
