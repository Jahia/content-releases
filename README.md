## Overview
When preparing an update of a web project (e.g. a new product launch or a marketing campaign),
editors work on pages and content that can be spread across the website.
The *content releases* module offer a convenient way to keep track of the content which has been
created/modified, and published on the go-live.

### How does it work?
In a dedicated panel, available in **jContent>Additional>Content Release Manager**, users can create a new content release.

To associate pages or content to a release, editors need to open Content Editor, activate the option
*Release Manager*, and then select the available releases. It is possible to attach a content/page to several releases.
Then Save.

Back in **jContent>Additional>Content Release Manager**, you can then see the list of content releases,
and the number of associated content. By clicking on the line, a new tab will open,
and will list all the contents of the release.

From there, you can: Open Content Editor to directly make modifications on the content
Use the *Open in Page Composer* option, to either open the page in Page Composer,
or to open the page containing the content in Page Composer.
